# GSOC-proposal
An example gsoc proposal for reference purposes

There was a time when I was out of ideas to write on proposal but slowly it kind-of builds up. Looking on examples surely helps, not a lot but 2-3 good proposals are more than enough just required to be read closely. An example can give a blueprint for your proposal. You get the idea of what actually to think upon, a bird view picture.
